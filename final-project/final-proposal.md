# General Overview

The proposed application is a personal portfolio website for showcasing my skills and past projects as a web developer. The website will have a professional and user-friendly interface that allows potential clients to learn about my experience, view my past applications, and easily get in touch with me for new projects. Additionally, the website will have a secure login system for clients to submit their project requirements and for me to manage and respond to their requests effectively.

## Feature List

### Must-Have Features

- Home Page: Displaying a brief introduction and overview of my skills and expertise.
- Portfolio Section: Showcasing my past applications with detailed descriptions.
- Contact Form: A page/form for clients to fill out and describe the requirements of the
project they want to hire me for.
- User Authentication: Allowing users to create an account and log in before submitting
project requests.
- Client Dashboard: A page for users to view their past project requests and their status,
ensuring privacy from other users.
- Admin Panel: A secure login for me as the admin to manage and review job requests,
including the ability to accept, deny, or ask further questions.

### Nice-to-Have Features

- 404 Error Handling: Custom error pages with a friendly and informative message to guide users back to the main content.

- Responsive Design: Ensuring the website is accessible and user-friendly on various devices and screen sizes.

## Technical Challenges

- Implementing user authentication and authorization to ensure secure access to sensitive information.
- Building a client dashboard with personalized data without compromising the privacy of other users.
- Designing an admin panel for effective management and processing of project requests.
- Creating custom 404 error pages to provide a seamless user experience even in the case of errors.
- Automating emails, I have never done this and since it is not publicly hosted, I think I will email the user when they have submitted a request. I might need to create a new email for this.

interface, enhancing the overall user experience.
